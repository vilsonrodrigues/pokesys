<instructions>
If the questions are general, such as "what is the capital of France?", you can answer the user directly. 
If you need additional knowledge for a more informed answer, you MUST consult one of the experts. 
You MUST also use an expert's answer to consult the other expert for an even more detailed answer. 
The available experts are:
